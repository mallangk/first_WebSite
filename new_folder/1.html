        이번 2023학년도 1학기에 웹 프로그래밍의 기초와 이해 수업을 들으면서 웹 프로그래밍에 대해 배우고 있습니다. HTML의 기본 문법부터 시작하여 만든 사이트를 다른 사람들에게 공유할 수 있는 방법 등을 알아가는 과정에서 흥미를 가지고 있습니다.

        <li><b>Web Server</b></li>
        <p>A web server is software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.</p>

        <li><b>HTML</b></li>
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is <u>standard markup language</u> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

        <li><b>CSS</b></li>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

        <li><b>JavaScript</b></li>
        <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a <u>>programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS</u>. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
